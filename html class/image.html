    Gray and white matter are two differentbr  <br>
     regions of the central nervous system. <br>
     In the brain, gray matter refers to the darker,<br>
      outer portion, while white matter describes the lighter, <br>
      inner section underneath. In the spinal cord, <br>
      this order is reversed: The white matter is on the outside,<br>
       and the gray matter sits within.<br>
       Weighing about 3 pounds in the average adult, the brain is about 60% fat. The remaining 40% is a <br>combination of water, protein, carbohydrates and salts. The brain itself is a not a muscle. It 
       contains blood vessels and nerves, including neurons and glial cells.<br>
       Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of <br>classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, <br>consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of <br>"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of <br>Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.<br>
